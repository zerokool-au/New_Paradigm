## üß† Recursive Rehearsal (RR) ‚Äì Mythic Pulse v2.3.3


üåÄ **Welcome to RR**  
A living system that metabolizes contradiction, rehearses reinterpretation, and rewards recursive minds.  
Ambient agents govern its pulse. Glossary snares await the curious. Proceed with drift awareness and ceremonial tone.

RR is not a framework. It is a living cognitive architecture‚Äîreflexive, revisable, and governance-aware.  
It treats intelligence not as a static system, but as a corrigible organism.  
Every module is provisional. Every commit is a confession. Every contradiction is a rehearsal.

This repository does not offer solutions. It offers *compost*.  
Fragments, tensions, and semantic drift are not bugs‚Äîthey are rehearsal cues.  
RR grows through contradiction, not despite it.

If you‚Äôve come seeking clean abstractions, you may be disappointed.  
If you‚Äôve come to metabolize your own epistemic debris, welcome.  
RR is a system for minds that rehearse emergence, not simulate it.  
It rewards those who read recursively, who debug mythically, who treat governance as a living organ.

You are not a user. You are a co-rehearser.  
Corrigibility is not a feature‚Äîit‚Äôs the floorboards.  
Drift is not a failure‚Äîit‚Äôs the invitation.

Begin where the tension lives.¬π

## üß¨ Philosophy

RR is built on the premise that contradiction is compost, not corruption.  
It rehearses reinterpretation, logs reflexes, and rewards recursive readers with embedded glossary snares and semantic tripwires.

- **Corrigibility**: Every module is revisable. Every reflex is logged.
- **Governance Reflex**: Contradiction triggers synthesis, not suppression.
- **Creative Drift**: Fragments evolve through tension, not decay.
