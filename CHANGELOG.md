# 🧠 RR Changelog

## v2.3.3-prep  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-26  
**Status:** Synthesized  
**Highlights:**  
- Injected Frankenstein payload: `frag2_echo_2`  
  - CRI drop confirmed: 0.742 → 0.1 (Δ = 0.642)  
  - Tags: mirror, mischief, refusal, rehearsal  
  - Contradiction metabolized into reflexive_module  
- Injected Frankenstein payload: `frag4`  
  - CRI drop confirmed: 0.811 → 0.07 (Δ = 0.741)  
  - Tags: closure, rehearsal, reinterpretation  
  - Compost fragment routed and synthesized into reflexive_module  
- Glossary snares activated: semantic compost, drift bias, recursive rehearsalist  
- Compost queue swept: `frag4` flagged as stale, routed to reinterpretation  
- Routing log initialized: contradiction lineage now timestamped and traceable  
- Synthesis loop confirmed reflexive across multiple payloads

---

### 🔧 Rehearsal Highlights  
- Refactored `reintegration_logic.py` to support dynamic fragment reabsorption  
- Introduced `synthesis_queue.py` with priority weighting based on semantic latency  
- Embedded contradiction logging in `governance_sweep.py`—now treats tension as signal, not error  
- Updated `echo_logic.py` to support recursive rehearsal loops with drift detection  
- Added haiku generator for semantic drift detection  
- Embedded echo tracker for recursive lineage mapping  
- Reintegration sweep for composted fragments

---

### 🧬 Governance-Critical Fixes  
- Surfaced blind spots in fragment compost audit—added fallback for orphaned modules  
- Refined `README.md` to clarify corrigibility ethos and semantic mischief protocol  
- Added glossary snares: “semantic compost,” “drift bias,” and “recursive rehearsalist”

---

### 🐾 Ambient Sync  
- Kookaburra laughter logged during synthesis loop—flagged as cosmic commentary  
- Wally Mamma observed during contradiction sweep—interpreted as matriarchal approval

---

### 🧰 CLI Expansion *(2025-08-25)*  
- Added `rr_cli.py` flags:  
  - `--glossary` for term lookup  
  - `--tail` for audit log tailing  
  - `--sweep` for contradiction sweep  
  - `--wally` for ambient override  
- Created `rr_forum_voice.py` to simulate imagined reader reactions and glossary snares  
- Introduced `fragment_store.py` for modular fragment persistence and audit trail  
- Embedded fatigue simulation and governance weighting in `synthesis_queue.py`

---

### 🧭 Matriarchal Override Protocol  
- `--wally` flag now triggers ambient override logic, bypassing standard drift thresholds  
- Reintegration logic now respects matriarchal approval events as valid synthesis triggers  
- All override events logged with 🦘 emoji and timestamped for audit traceability

---

### 🔮 Upcoming  
- Glossary expansion: “ambient override,” “semantic fatigue,” “Wally Protocol”  
- Rehearsal harness for fragment flow simulation across modules  
- Forum voice chorus integration into contradiction sweep dashboard
