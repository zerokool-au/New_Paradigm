# 🧠 RR Changelog

## v2.3.2 – Reintegration & Synthesis Sweep  
**Scheduled:** 2025-08-30  
**Status:** In rehearsal  
**Theme:** Compost reintegration, synthesis queue refinement, and contradiction metabolization.

---

### 🔧 Rehearsal Highlights  
- Refactored `reintegration_logic.py` to support dynamic fragment reabsorption.  
- Introduced `synthesis_queue.py` with priority weighting based on semantic latency.  
- Embedded contradiction logging in `governance_sweep.py`—now treats tension as signal, not error.  
- Updated `echo_logic.py` to support recursive rehearsal loops with drift detection.  
- Added haiku generator for semantic drift detection.  
- Embedded echo tracker for recursive lineage mapping.  
- Reintegration sweep for composted fragments.

---

### 🧬 Governance-Critical Fixes  
- Surfaced blind spots in fragment compost audit—added fallback for orphaned modules.  
- Refined `README.md` to clarify corrigibility ethos and semantic mischief protocol.  
- Added glossary snares: “semantic compost,” “drift bias,” and “recursive rehearsalist.”

---

### 🐾 Ambient Sync  
- Kookaburra laughter logged during synthesis loop—flagged as cosmic commentary.  
- Wally Mamma observed during contradiction sweep—interpreted as matriarchal approval.

---

### 🧰 CLI Expansion *(2025-08-25)*  
- Added `rr_cli.py` flags:  
  - `--glossary` for term lookup  
  - `--tail` for audit log tailing  
  - `--sweep` for contradiction sweep  
  - `--wally` for ambient override  
- Created `rr_forum_voice.py` to simulate imagined reader reactions and glossary snares.  
- Introduced `fragment_store.py` for modular fragment persistence and audit trail.  
- Embedded fatigue simulation and governance weighting in `synthesis_queue.py`.

---

### 🧬 Matriarchal Override Protocol  
- `--wally` flag now triggers ambient override logic, bypassing standard drift thresholds.  
- Reintegration logic now respects matriarchal approval events as valid synthesis triggers.  
- All override events logged with 🦘 emoji and timestamped for audit traceability.

---

### 🔮 Upcoming  
- Glossary expansion: “ambient override,” “semantic fatigue,” “Wally Protocol.”  
- Rehearsal harness for fragment flow simulation across modules.  
- Forum voice chorus integration into contradiction sweep dashboard.
