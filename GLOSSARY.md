ðŸ§© RR Glossary â€“ Tripwires & Compost
Semantic Compost
The residue of contradiction, drift, and orphaned insight. Not discardedâ€”cultivated. Fuels recursive growth and reinterpretation.

Recursive Rehearsalist
A practitioner of cognitive rehearsal. Revisits fragments, metabolizes tension, and rehearses reinterpretation. Not a roleâ€”a rhythm.

Drift Bias
The gravitational pull of latent assumptions. Detected via Echo Logic, composted via contradiction sweep.

Echo Logic
A recursive sonar for meaning. Pings past fragments to clarify present synthesis. If it echoes, itâ€™s alive.

Contradiction Sweep
A governance-critical pass that logs tension, flags blind spots, and composts conflict. If it feels uncomfortable, youâ€™re metabolizing correctly.

Kookaburra Protocol
Ambient sync mechanism triggered by cosmic laughter. If the kookaburra laughs mid-synthesis, pause. Something wants to be noticed.

Matriarchal Approval
When Wally Mamma appears during contradiction logging. Treat it as a sign: the system is metabolizing with integrity.
